# TreasureMAP
A program that will mark a spot with an X. In the starting code, there is a variable called map.

This map contains a nested list. When map is printed this is what the nested list looks like:
[['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']]

The first digit in the input specifies the column (the position on the horizontal axis).
The second digit in the input will specifies the row number (the position on the vertical axis). 

So an input of 23 should place an X at the position shown below:
['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

['⬜️', 'X', '⬜️']
